## “Embrace Complexity”

-   *"There is no flood in a single raindrop, no financial crash in a single dollar, and no love in a single carbon atom. Yet, when combined under certain conditions, these simple elements create phenomena far greater and more complex than their individual parts." --- The Science of Complexity*

## Research Interests:

-   I am driven to understand the fundamental principles underlying biological processes like pattern formation, morphogenesis, and regeneration etc, through employing experimental and computational techniques, including scRNA‐seq, multi-omics integration,modeling the intricate dynamics of gene regulatory networks and the epigenetic landscape, ultimately seeking to control these systems through the combined power of systems biology and bioengineering.

## Fields of Interest in General:

-   Systems Biology

-   Computational Biology

-   Genetic Engineering

-   Evolutionary Biology

-   Developmental Biology

-   Regeneration and Morphogenesis

-   Self-Organization and Emergence

-   Multiscale Analysis of Cellular Systems

-   Complex Systems Modeling

-   Network Science

-   Swarm/Collective Intelligence

-   Evolutionary Game Theory

-   Convergent Evolution of GRNs

## Work Experience {style="page-break-before: no"}

### Research Internship

**University Hospital Freiburg**

\[ 03/04/2024 – 30/04/2024 \]

The lab focuses on elucidating the epigenetic mechnisms of caste transition and reversion in *Harpegnathos saltator* ant:

-   My role was primarily focused on conducting behavioral analysis of the *Harpegnathos saltator* ant colony during its transition phase induced by colony separation.

-   Other duties include ant colony maintenance, participating in weekly journal clubs etc.

### **Research Assistant**

**Human Movement and Motor Rehabilitation Laboratory**

International Institute of Child Study, Zhejiang Normal University

\[ 12/10/2021 – 02/12/2022 \]

-   The lab focuses on the behavioral correlates of neural mechanisms in the human brain.

-   I was trained on operating controlled EEG experiments on adult college volunteers, supervising them during the task of character recognition, conducting interviews and gathering information.
