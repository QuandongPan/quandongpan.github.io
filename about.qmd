## Research Interests:

-   I am driven to understand the **fundamental principles** of processes like **pattern formation, morphogenesis, and regeneration**, through modeling the intricate **dynamics** of **gene regulatory networks** and the **epigenetic landscape**, ultimately seeking to control these systems through the combined power of **systems biology** and **genetic engineering**.
