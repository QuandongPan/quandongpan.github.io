## Research Interests:

-   I am driven to understand the **fundamental principles underlying biological processes** like pattern formation, morphogenesis, and regeneration etc, through employing **experimental and computational techniques**, including scRNA‚Äêseq, multi-omics integration,modeling the intricate dynamics of gene regulatory networks and the epigenetic landscape, ultimately seeking to control these systems through the combined power of **systems biology and bioengineering**.
